Absolutely! Let’s **combine the clarity and stepwise approach of your original README with the deeper explanations and onboarding detail** of my previous template.

You’ll get:

* Concise, actionable “just do it” instructions
* Clear local vs. cloud deployment flows
* Full technical context for devs/DevOps/learners

# Shop-n-Serve CI/CD Lab

A modern backend lab demonstrating DevOps, CI/CD, and Cloud best practices  
with Python, Flask, Docker, LocalStack, Terraform, Helm, and GitHub Actions.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **AWS Account** (AWS Educate or standard, for real cloud runs)
- **Docker** (Desktop for Mac/Windows)
- **LocalStack** (for local AWS emulation)
- **Poetry** (Python dependency management)
- **Terraform** (Infra as code, required for AWS resources)
- **kubectl** & **Helm** (for K8s deployments)
- **AWS CLI** & **awscli-local**
- **Git**, **curl**

> _Install each via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on Mac, [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows, or your OS package manager._

---

## 2. Local Environment Setup

**For Local Development (NO real AWS billing):**

1. **Clone repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/shop-n-serve.git
   cd shop-n-serve
````

2. **SSH keys** (if using EC2/Terraform for real AWS):

   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/shopnserve_key
   ```

3. **Poetry dependencies**

   ```sh
   cd api
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Start LocalStack (emulated AWS: SQS, RDS, etc.)**

   ```sh
   docker run --rm -it -p 4566:4566 -e SERVICES=sqs,rds localstack/localstack:3
   ```

   > Or: `pip install localstack && localstack start -d`

5. **Create SQS queue in LocalStack**

   ```sh
   pip install awscli-local
   awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name orders-queue
   ```

6. **Set required environment variables**
   (use `.env` or export manually)

   ```
   AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
   AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566
   SQS_QUEUE_URL=http://localhost:4566/000000000000/orders-queue
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=admin
   DB_PASS=secret
   ```

7. **Run Flask API (or other services)**

   ```sh
   poetry run python handler.py
   ```

---

## 3. Project Structure

| Folder       | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **api/**     | Flask API, core logic, handler code    |
| **worker/**  | Lambda worker or SQS processing code   |
| **infra/**   | Terraform IaC configs, modules         |
| **charts/**  | Helm charts for K8s deployment         |
| **tests/**   | Unit and integration tests             |
| **.github/** | CI/CD workflows (ci.yml, cd.yml, etc.) |

---

## 4. Running Tests

**All (unit + integration):**

```sh
poetry run pytest
```

* Integration tests require LocalStack running.

---

## 5. Building & Running with Docker

```sh
docker build -t shopnserve/api:latest api/
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 shopnserve/api:latest
```

---

## 6. Infrastructure: Deploying to AWS

### **With Terraform**

```sh
cd infra/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

* Deploys SQS, DB, IAM, VPC, etc. as code
* Uses the SSH key generated above if deploying EC2

---

## 7. Deploying to Kubernetes (with Helm)

```sh
helm upgrade --install api charts/api
```

* Deploys the API as a K8s service (edit values in `charts/api/values.yaml` as needed)
* For local K8s: use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) or [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

---

## 8. End-to-End CI/CD via GitHub Actions

### **CI Workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml):**

* Lints, tests, builds on every PR/push
* Runs all tests (with LocalStack as a service container)
* Fails fast on error

### **CD Workflow (.github/workflows/cd.yml):**

* Triggered on successful CI (or manually)
* Builds and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub

### **Manual Triggers:**

* In GitHub: Go to “Actions”, choose workflow, click “Run workflow”
* Locally:

  ```sh
  act workflow_dispatch -W .github/workflows/cd.yml --container-architecture linux/amd64
  ```

---

## 9. Observability & Grafana

* Deploy Grafana with Docker:

  ```sh
  docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana-oss
  ```
* Default login: admin/admin
* Add Prometheus/CloudWatch/LocalStack metrics as a source
* Import [dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards) for SQS, MySQL, or your custom metrics

---

## 10. Health Check / API Smoke Test

* After Helm or Docker deployment:

  ```sh
  curl http://shopnserve.nip.io/health
  ```

---

## 11. FAQ / Troubleshooting

* **NoRegionError**?
  Make sure `AWS_REGION` is exported everywhere (`.env`, CI, shell).
* **Docker port conflicts?**
  Check that nothing else is running on 4566 or 8000.
* **Want to extend?**
  Add new modules/services under `api/`, infra to `infra/`, update Helm as needed.

---

## 12. Example .env File

```
AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566
SQS_QUEUE_URL=http://localhost:4566/000000000000/orders-queue
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASS=secret
```

---

## 13. Contributing
